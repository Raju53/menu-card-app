## Project Overview

This web application provides a user-friendly way to view the Bachelor's Kitchen menu online.  It aims to make it easy for customers to explore the restaurant's offerings and find what they're looking for. The menu is organized into categories, and users can filter items by dietary preference (vegetarian or non-vegetarian).

## Features

*   **Categorized Menu:** Dishes are organized into logical categories (Soups, Starters, Main Course, etc.) for easy navigation.
*   **Veg/Non-Veg Filter:** Users can filter the menu to display only vegetarian or non-vegetarian items.
*   **Responsive Design:** The menu adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Dynamic Content:** The menu items and categories are dynamically loaded (in this example, from a JavaScript data structure, but could be from a database or API in a real-world scenario).
*   **Visually Appealing:** The menu uses CSS to create a clean and attractive presentation.

## Technologies Used
